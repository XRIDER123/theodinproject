 <p>
These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:

· Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
· Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
· Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
· Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
· Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
· Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
· Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
· Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
· Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).

Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings

    ½ pound ground pork

    ½ pound lean ground beef

    ½ cup minced onion

    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

    1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

    2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided

    1 clove garlic, crushed

    1 ½ teaspoons dried basil

    1 ½ teaspoons salt

    ½ teaspoon dried oregano

    ⅛ teaspoon white sugar

    1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles

    1 pound small-curd cottage cheese

    ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

    3 large eggs

    2 teaspoons salt

    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

    1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
</ul>
<ol>
Steps 

    Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.

    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

    While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

    While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.

    Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.

    Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.

    Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

This incredible zucchini roll lasagna doesn't contain any pasta. Instead, thin zucchini strips are rolled around a 3-cheese filling and baked over a savory turkey Bolognese. The presentation is truly next level.

Steps
    For cheese filling: Place ricotta, Parmigiano Reggiano, mozzarella, egg, black pepper, salt, cayenne, and parsley in a bowl, and stir together until combined; refrigerate until needed.

    For Bolognese: Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet, and add Italian turkey sausage, onions, and a pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up the sausage with a spatula, until browned and broken into small crumbles, 5 to 7 minutes. 

    Stir in marinara sauce, water, and cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Sauce can be cooked longer, adding small amounts of water as needed to maintain consistency. 

    Transfer sauce into a 13x9-inch baking dish and set aside.

    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

    For zucchini rolls: trim ends of zucchini with a knife and then use a vegetable peeler to make lengthwise strips. For best results, use only the largest, widest center-cut pieces. You can also place two thinner pieces overlapped side-by-side. You will need to make a total of 30 zucchini rolls.

    Lay out zucchini strips on a work surface. Spread each strip with about 2 rounded teaspoons of cheese mixture and roll up.

    Place filled strips on top of sauce in the baking dish in a 5x6 pattern. Scatter grated Parmigiano Reggiano and grated mozzarella evenly over the top, and drizzle with olive oil. 

    Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, and cheese has started to brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss together butternut squash, 2 teaspoons of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.

    Bake in the preheated oven until softened and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.

    Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add spinach, and cook, stirring often, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.

    Combine shredded provolone and mozzarella in a bowl. Stir together ricotta, parsley, eggs, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded cheese mixture, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.

    Lightly coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup of the marinara on the bottom. Arrange 4 noodles side by side over sauce; spread half of ricotta mixture over noodles. Spread roasted squash evenly over ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 cups marinara. Top with 4 more noodles and remaining ricotta mixture. Spread spinach mixture evenly over ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 cups marinara. Top with remaining 4 noodles and 1 cup marinara. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining shredded cheese mixture. Cover with aluminum foil. 

    Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Uncover; bake until golden and bubbly, about 20 minutes more. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into 10 slices.
